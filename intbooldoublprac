/* The Challenge: The Automated Irrigation Controller
Prompt: Write a Java code segment for an irrigation system. You are given the following input variables (assume they are already declared and initialized):

int currentHour: The current hour of the day (0–23).

double soilMoisture: The percentage of moisture in the soil (0.0–100.0).

double temperature: The current temperature in Fahrenheit.

boolean isRaining: Whether it is currently raining.

Requirements:

Declare a boolean variable named shouldWater.

The system should water (shouldWater = true) only if:

It is not raining.

The soilMoisture is less than 30.0%.

The currentHour is either in the early morning (before 6 AM) or late evening (after 9 PM / hour 21).

Override Rule: If the temperature is above 95.0 degrees, the system must water regardless of the hour, as long as it is not raining and the moisture is below 30.0%.

Calculate the double totalWaterNeeded. If shouldWater is true, the amount is (100.0 - soilMoisture) * 0.5. If shouldWater is false, the amount is 0.0.
